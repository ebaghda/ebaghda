# About me 
Hello and welcome to my github profile! I am a PhD student at the University of Colorado Boulder, performing interdisciplinary research within the fields of colloid and interfacial science and heterogeneous catalysis to develop advanced materials and techniques for sustainable energy applications. Take a look at my publications list below for more details!

## My Current Work:
- I'm interested in heterogeneous catalysis for biofuel conversion and hydrogen storage and utilizaiton, active matter fundamentals and applications, big data, and applied statistics
- Iâ€™m currently researching self-diffusiophoretic (self-propelled) particles as sensors to quantify molecular adsorption in liquid media
